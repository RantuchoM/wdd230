            <h2>3 Nephi 11:3</h2>
            <p>3 And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a avoice as if it
                came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they
                heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it
                being a bsmall voice it did cpierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of
                their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause
                their hearts to burn.</p>
